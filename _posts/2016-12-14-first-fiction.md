### Writing Fiction

My inspiration for writing blog posts about my day-to-day thoughts and musings seems to have been dry lately. It occurred to me that I should instead try my hand at writing some fiction. The following link is to a short story I've written. It's part of a much larger story that I've had in my head for a while, but I think it stands alone as a cool short in its own right. Perhaps it would be the Opening chapter, or prolog to an eventual longer story. It took me about an hour and a half to write, though that includes the time to figure out exactly what story I wanted to tell.
