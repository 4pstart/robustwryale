### Why Am I Writing?

Since I've decided to apply myself to learning how to write, I have started to read some blogs and other advice columns on how to be a better writer, where to target my writing, etc. The hardest part is in deciding what exactly I want my focus and audience to be. Am I trying to turn this into something I can earn money from? Maybe something to augment my existing career? I haven't even tried to write a tech blog of any type, and yet that's obviously where I should be focussing my efforts if "career enhancement" is my goal. Honestly though, that sounds super dry, and I think that's why I haven't even tried to do it yet. What are some potential such blog posts I could write?

 - How we moved from releasing every 8 weeks to every week.
 - What's preventing us from releasing continuously; Our journey to getting ourselves in a position to do that
 - Striking a balance between letting engineers feel free to use what tech stack, tools, etc they want, versus maintaining consistency across teams/products
 - My experience with Scrum vs Kanban
 - The importance and difficultly of finding leaders for every team
 - My experience working with remote teams
 - My experience taking over an established team
 - Is the start-up work culture ultimately unhealthy?
 - Convincing you that you need a strong engineering manager early.
 
There! I just came up with 9 ideas in about 5 minutes. Challenge to self: next blog post should be on one of these topics. Maybe I'll love it? I sure do like to talk about this shit with my friends. I also like rant about topics I claim to know something about. Seems like something I ought to be able to get into...

#### current writing projects

I tried to start a science/science news blog. To date I've written a single post. I did enjoy writing that post, but again, I'm having a hard time coming up with a more precise focus for that blog. I loosely wanted it to be about cutting through the BS of normal science blog posting. Attempting to write for people who are genuinely interested in science and recent developments, but without resorting to clickbait or sensationalistic headlines. I'm certainly qualified to read scientific journals and interpret the results. I also consider one of my strengths as being able to break down complex notions for interested 'laypeople'. This feels like a great avenue to explore. And yet I have had the worst writers block in this area. I think my problem is that I don't know whether I want to focus on up-to-the-minute news, or on broader, potentially more complex topics. Ironically, I think I really want to write about both, but I think there's too much content and work to be done between covering both of those that I end up overwhelmed and doing neither. Challenge to self: pick a "broad, complex" topic, such as global warming, sea level rises, or something less over-analysed and draft up an in-depth article. I can still cover the odd "hot topic" as I feel like. 

#### potential future projects

I like the idea of writing a wrestling blog. I'm really enjoying WWE right now, and while some aspects of the fan-coverage are decent, I do feel it's somewhat lacking. One thought I had is to do a blog that completely keeps kayfabe at all costs. Another idea Ive had is that of the "spoiler free review"  for wrestling events. I know from personal experience that it would be super helpful to know whether I should bother watching, say, a particular episode of raw. And furthermore which segments are worth watching and which I'm fine just reading a summary of. I suppose I should start by just doing this with Raw and/or Smackdown every week.

It also occurred to me to write either a single post or possibly an ongoing series that attempts to explain why I find wrestling so interesting and compelling to a non-fan noob, who must surely see the whole thing as a bizarre thing for an otherwise smart-seeming guy to be so interested in. This is probably a little too close to what How2Wrestling does, but maybe it's sufficiently interesting to me, or I can come up with a different take on the idea.

At some point I might like to try my hand at non-fiction. This is a somewhat intimidating prospect, but I think it could be fun, rewarding and enlightening. I suppose I should start with short stories before potentially moving onto the next great best-selling novel... That means I need to come up with some interesting ideas to write stories about. I'm not sure I really have any of those right now, so I'll have to percolate on this one.
