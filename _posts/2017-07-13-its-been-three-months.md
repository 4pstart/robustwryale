What an interesting 3 months it's been since my last post!

I feel that so far my year breaks very interestingly along quarters. 

### Q1 2017

So, I believe I did a relatively great job of blogging my Q1. As a result I'm only going to summarize it here: Travel.

I ended 2016 and began 2017 in Hawaii. A couple of days upon returning to Denver I left for Scotland for a week. Up on my return I almost immediately left for SF to meet my mum, fly to Fiji, then New Zealand, with a brief stop in Sydney, before a day trip on my own in Fiji and back home. Then back to California where I met my mum for a few days in SB. A few (four?) weeks later, flew to Amsterdam, spent a couple of days there before heading up to Scotland, then England, then Orlando for WM, before finally getting back to Denver right at the start of Q2 for the next chapter of my life.

### Q2 2017

My crazy 3 months of travels behind me, I refocussed on getting a house and getting my life in order. By mid April I had an offer accepted on a house and was spending a lot of time hanging out with Dani, and going through the final phase of training for the Colfax half marathon.

May mostly consisted of doing the work to close on my house (eventually closing on the 19th, and moving in a week later on the 26th), starting to think about dating again, re-connecting with S (!!!) and buying a Porsche 911 convertible. Oh, and I came 91st out of 4500 in the Colfax Half.

My June was filled with the work done to move into my place, buy the things I need, get otherwise straightened out, knowing that my Mum, brother, sister-in-law and 7-month-old niece would be visiting at the end of the month. Right before their visit, I flew to Tahoe to spend a fun-filled weekend for Yoshi's bachelor party. It was very much 'good, clean fun', but no less awesome because of it. I need to go back to Tahoe.

But once I returned... what a family visit that was! My life was just finally starting to feel great, I was the consistently-happiest I'd been in months and suddenly chaos descended. I have never felt more stressed than I did on their first day here. It's been 2 days since they left and I think I'm still feeling the effects of it, despite taking Tuesday 11th off altogether. 

### Looking forward to Q3

Meanwhile things have been going amazingly well with S (you know, as well as they can until she realizes she loves me back and actually properly allows herself to be vulnerable with me). I've been to the most amazing concert (Flume at Red Rocks), seen a coupe of great movies (Wonder Woman, Baby Driver), continued to develop a healthy, valuable friendship with Dani, continued to enjoy my Porsche (especially since I put in the fancy stereo) and got hooked on Magic the Gathering. Seems like I've set myself a great foundation to have an equally interesting Q3, I just need to spend a little time deciding what I want it to be filled with.

Oh yeah, the love of my life is moving 1300 miles away in about 2.5 weeks.
