title: "Getting Over Her"

In my previous post I discussed how a tricky 'break up' I went through inspired me to make the most of my recent travel, and to use the time to talk through life, love and everything else with a vast array of friends and family, old and recent.

Inspired by the following article, I decided I need to go through and list some important things I got out of that relationship, spell out what exactly I find myself fundamentally missing since then, and to look forward to what I can do in my own life to be happy moving forward.

I could certainly add a lot more that I will below, but I'd like to keep this post somewhat brief, not least so I give myself a manageable set of goals to work towards.

##### Things I miss and how to get them again

- She have a good proportion of the things in common, from hobbies and activities like comics & graphic novels, games (but don't get to play that often), sci-fi and brunch; to broader philosophic & lifestyle ideals, like religion, politics, foods and our lack of desire to have kids. But a great amount of things _not_ in common too. Enough activities we can do on our own. Sufficiently diverse friend groups that we could spend time together or separate with either. She has a wonderful sense of style, and introduced me to a new appreciation for artistic endeavors.

I believe I can find each of these things individually relatively easily. I already have friends with many of the commonalities I just listed. I may even have friends with _most_ of the commonalities listed. I'm not sure I've ever met anyone who feels like quite such a great 'match', but that doesn't mean that there aren't others out there. Or that I can't engage more with a group of friends that cover the above bases overall. It's always nice to meet someone who you can share these kinds of passions with, but that doesn't proclude me from finding _more_ people I can share these things with.

- She makes me smile. Even sitting here now, having gone through the above list and thinking about what I like about her, I find myself smiling. I can't think of a time I've ever smiled as often, or a person I've ever smiled as consistently around, as I do around her. She's just so... _wonderful_ that it makes me happy to be in her presence. 

Boy. I suppose I can keep looking - it's not like I'm a crazy ladies man who's dated hundreds of women, or a super outgoing guy making friends left and right at every bar I go to. Is that really enough experience to know what's out there? There must be plenty of people out there who can make me smile in that same way, even if it's not romantic. I need to participate in more activities that force me to interact with people, and see what's out there. Even if no one person can make me smile all the time, I'm sure I can find a collection of people who can each make me smile when I see them once in a while!

- She never made my dorkishness feel like a bad thing. In fact she seemed to like it. Now I know I've met others who have enjoyed my dorkiness too, but somehow this seemed that little bit more sincere. Or, perhaps, less like I was a 'novelty', and more that my quirky set of likes & dislikes was legitimately pretty cool. Maybe she just made me feel like that's what she felt, but it's not something I've felt in any previous romantic relationships that I can recall.  

Now, I for sure have friends who I can be 'myself' in front of, and they certainly don't seem to mind me - in fact many of them genuinely seem to like me. I'm not sure if any of them 'love' me (whatever that really means). Perhaps better said would be that if they do love me, it's for other aspects of my personality than what gets me passionate. Or maybe some subset of the things that make me passionate. Part of the problem here, perhaps, is that I feel I have to hide some of my quirkiness when I first meet someone, and introduce them to it slowly. Thus I'm rarely my 'true' self around people and don't get to see whether they would like me even more for the person I actually am. Again, this is only something I can truly address my meeting more people, and by being slightly more 'myself' when I am around new people, so I find out early if they're someone I want to be around.

- I could probably list more than the above. I could certainly go into way more detail, and break each of the above into multiple sub points, but these feel like plenty to be getting on with, and I can always revisit this exercise in the future if I need to.

##### Conclusion

I need to stay on my current course. There will be days (like the first one back at home after a long stay away) where I'm feeling more emotional, maybe vulnerable, and that I'm going to be missing her. There are also going to be days where it doesn't feel so bad - but only if I persist with the ideas above. Even if we started seeing each other again tomorrow, I have given myself some good advice in this post, and I would be best served in following it regardless.
