### Why do I enjoy pro-wrestling?

This April I'm heading to Orlando to spend 5 days enjoying (Western) pro-wrestling's event of the year - WrestleMania. I'll be attending at least 7 shows, I'll probably see at least 30-40 matches, all the famous names, and am expecting to generally have the time of my life. But how could a put-together, educated man such as myself, get such enjoyment out of something so... silly?

As I sit down to write this post, I'm not sure I really have a good answer for this myself, but here are some thoughts.

##### There are multiple ways to be a 'good wrestler'

At the highest level, there are essentially two subtly different things one can mean by 'good wrestler'. There's what the show presents as top-of-the-sport championship contenders, versus the bottom-of-the-card perennial losers. But there's also the 'in-the-know'/'real' sense in which a performer is good at the various aspects of their job, such as athleticism in the ring, ability to get the audience to 'buy what they're selling', skill on the microphone to convince the audience they're to be reckoned with, etc. 

So, it's very rare for a 5'6", 150lb guy to ever be considered a championship contender, who could realistically compete with the behemoths at the top of the sport. The audience would never buy it. This guy will probably not be considered a 'good wrestler' in the sense that the TV show presents to its audience. But, on the other hand, he might actually be a very good wrestler in the sense that he is compelling to watch. Perhaps he does a great job of helping you to suspend disbelief, and getting you to root for him to win (or lose!).

At the most basic level, wrestling fans enjoy watching the latter type of 'good wrestler'. I suppose it's really fun to simply observe someone being really good at their job - especially when that job is entertainment.

##### Winning and losing is still important

I'm not stupid - I know that the results of wrestling matches are predetermined. But the people running a wrestling company want you to be able to suspend disbelief and buy into what they're selling. Part of that means you have to be convinced that a championship contender is 'good' in both senses I described above. They have to be convincing within the confines of the show as presented, but they also need to be genuinely compelling to watch. When a wrestling company chooses to make a wrestler their champion, they're saying "we want this person to be the 'face' of our company. This person is a sufficiently good performer that they are the best choice right now to be the in-show person-to-beat". Becoming the champion of a wrestling promotion is a big deal, both on screen, and in 'real life'.

##### It's exciting in the same way as 'real' sports. 

Now, I could (and maybe should?) devote an entire post to why sport in general is entertaining. Undoubtedly many, many others have already written articles on this topic. Let's take it for a given that many people can find huge entertainment in watching other humans try their hardest to beat each other in athletic contests. I frequently find myself leaping around and yelling with joy when Arsenal score an important goal, and a big win can leave me happy for days afterwards. Likewise, for better or worse, a big loss leaves me feeling genuinely miserable. Anyone who knows me will realize that I rarely get this outwardly excitable or emotional.

That said, there are many times I watch a match and really don't get too excited. If Arsenal score a couple of early goals against weaker opposition and then quietly close out the game 2-0, that's not especially exciting. I watch because I don't know in advance if a match is going to be super exciting or not (and when it's good, it's _really_ good). But sometimes it's not that great.

Professional wrestling, when done well, can provide a very similar level of tension and excitement. Ultimately, does it matter from the perspective of the viewer if the winner is predetermined? But, better still, the matches are 'choreographed' so that they're always trying to be compelling, and so that you're just not sure who will win, right until the end - almost every time. 

Very little in the realm of scripted television entertains me in quite this way. I've definitely exclaimed aloud watching Game of Thrones. There are a handful of comedy shows that can really make me belly-laugh and leave me happy after they're over. But such shows are few and far between. Wrestling is such a show.

##### Blurring the lines

Wrestling is in a weird spot where basically everyone watching knows it's predetermined, and yet the very premise of the show is that the competitors involved very much want to win. As described above, however, winning vs losing is important, even in 'real life'. When a wrestler wins, that's good for their career in general. As a fan of that performer, I want them to succeed, because I want to see more of them - in bigger, longer, more spectacular matches, against top quality opponents with high-stakes. When a wrestler is handed a microphone, they have to convince a viewer who knows this is all 'fake' that they really do want to kick that other person's ass. Internet savvy fans hear about backstage rumors - who is friends with whom, and who has beef with whom. The producers of the show use this to their advantage and pit wrestlers against each other who might have genuine stakes in 'real life'. It adds to the oddly compelling nature of the whole thing - you're often left not quite sure where real-life ends and the show begins.

##### Conclusion

So, these are a few reasons why I enjoy wrestling. Ultimately it's live, high-impact theatre. These men and women are really putting their bodies on the line, they're really flying through the air, flipping around, being slammed through that table and they're doing it in such a way that they still put on a compelling contest where you don't know who's going to come out victorious. It's just really good fun.

You should watch it! If reading this has left you curious, I'd be delighted to give some recommendations!
