first day of Wrestlemania weekend. 

 After just 4 hours sleep, I got up at 3:40am, to catch 4am shuttle to airport, to catch 5:30am flight. Turns out Newark kinda sucks and it took 40 minutes to get from where the shuttle dropped us off (at 4:10) to the Southwest checkin, so I only checked in at 4:50 and nearly missed the flight. After making it to Orlando, I way overpaid for a black cab to the Rosen hotel, which is in the middle of tourist town (super close to universal studios). There were already a bunch of wrestling fans everywhere :) I couldn't check in right away, since it was only 9:30am, but I left my bags there, had a surprisingly decent buffet breakfast at the hotel (for $12, coffee included), drank about 6 cups of coffee, and availed myself of the facilities in the lobby. At about 11 I got an uber up to the Orland Events Center, which is frickin miles away from the rest of the weekend's events, but is where WWN had set up operations. 

### Show 1: Progress - Orlando. 

It was really cool to see Progress live after I've watched maybe the first 19 shows on their on-demand site over the past month (though I suppose I did get spoiled about who is current champ, Havoc apparently being a babyface again, etc). Havoc vs Jack Sbre Jr was the first match (probably because Sabre had to get back down south for some other events). One of teh first Progress shows I watched had these guys fight and it was a big part of Havoc being recognised as a 'real' wrestler, so it was fun to see them at it again a few years on. Memorable moments: there was a really good tag match between 2 teams I didn't know. Dunne, Bate and Seven are good characters, got cheers and boos. Fun to see the wwe uk title on the line (Bate vs Mark Andrews). Dunne defended the progress title against a babyface Mark Haskins. I think there were 3 title matches and I guess I kinda hoped at least 1 would change hands but it was a bit predictable in that none did. Honestly I really like the promoter Jim Smallman, and it was cool to see him do his thing and he was also wandering about the lobby before teh show, while I was in line for beer - I marked out to see him haha. Bought 2 tshirts that I'm very happy with. 

After the show it was a nightmare to get back down to the Wyndham hotel, across the street from the Rosen where I was staying. I guess the majority of people at Progress also wanted to get down there in time for the 4pm RevPro show, but with us only getting out around 3pm and there being 40+ minutes of traffic already, it was never going to be easy. I had numerous Ubers cancel on me, but eventually found a group of 3 (British) lads who didn't mind letting me join them for a ride down South. Made it into the RevPro show about 40 minutes late, though evidently I only missed 1 match.

### Show 2: RevPro

I believe I caught 3 matches before the interval and another 2 after, before taking off to go and check into my hotel, eat some food, nap, before heading back over for the 8:30pm show. 

Will Osprey had a great match against Fenix (who I don't know but I hear is popular). Lord whats-his-name had a joke match against Swoggle. Marty Scurll is always fun and had a match against Ricochet. Looks like I missed ZSJ vs Pentagon :/  (https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=171710). Nothing super memorable, but solid and entertaining all around. I suspect my jetlag/lack of sleep caught up with me to some degree, since I don't recall much of this event. Sat on front row of bleachers for the pre-interval matches, then a bit higher up post-interval.

### Show 3: WrestleCon Supershow

This was great fun. I'll start with the 20-man battle royal for the defended 24-hour, whatcha-call-it (DDT) heavy-metal-weight championship. The champion (Joey Ryan) is evidently super popular, and I can kinda see why, though it seems to me a little but like his talent is being soewhat wasted by being a comedy character (seriously, part of his gimmick is that he has some kind of weaponized junk, so when people kick him in the balls, it hurts their feet. Also, he put some guys hand on his dick and then the guy was in pain and couldn't let go, at which point Ryan swvieled his hips in such a way as to throw the guy over the top rope (thus eliminating him with his genitals)). The participants came down every minute and were all surprise entrants. They included Billy Gunn, Abyss, The Hurricane, a very old (and possibly drunk) Marty Jannety (!), and eventual winner, Swoggle. Immediately after the match, Ryan pinned Swoggle to get his title back, before the Sandman (!!) came out, did his epic entrance, hit Ryan with a kendo stick and won the title. Evidently, shortly after (backstage) Ryan was able to get the belt back (via Swoggle) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At_tGh09PR0.

The match of the day was also on this show - a 10-man tag, Team Osprey vs Team Ricochet. Honestly it was absurd how much action was in the match (which also included a dance-off half way through). The crowd were roaring throughout, great stuff, if super indy-riffic. It's interesting - in matches like this it maybe makes it obvious that they're not really 'wrestling' for real, but on the other hand they make it clear before and after that all these guys are buddies, so maybe that offers a kayfabe-ish explanation as to why?

The crowd were great throughout the show (though a little exhausted by midnight, and after jumping around like crazy for the above 2 matches). The final 2 matches were a mediocre TLC match and the Hardys vs Rey Fenix & Pentagon Jr, which was very short and pretty disappointing, though I imagine at this point (12:30) they wanted to finish and go home.

In the end I made it back to the hotel room very tired, at 1am. I got a decent night's sleep ready for day 2...
