I'm writing this from the final stop on what's been an eventful 2 months of travel. I travel often so it's not entirely clear when to consider my recent bout of trips to have started, though December 29th marks the start of a particularly intensive period of travel, in which I've taken 19 flights in 45 days.

### Prologue - November & Early December 2016

My Mum came to visit the US the weekend following Thanksgiving - she flew in to Las Vegas on Saturday November 26th, so on the morning of Black Friday I jumped in my car and did the 10 hour drive down to Vegas. I stayed the night in a slightly weird AirBnB, watched some football in a British pub and visited the Pinball Museum before meeting her at the airport and driving her up to a hotel just outside Zion, where we spent the night. 

We got up early on a very chilly morning on Sunday 27th to visit Zion before the crowds - it is a beautiful park, but we didn't do any of the hikes to the (supposedly) particularly spectacular view points. After getting our fill of Zion we jumped back in the car to head to Bryce Canyon - or, more specifically, to a hotel about 15 minutes _past_ the entrance to the park, which is more-or-less at the top of a mountain. Unfortunately the weather had taken a turn for the worse. We had to drive through an unpleasant snow storm as we headed past Bryce on our way to the hotel, and the forecast was even worse for the next day, with widespread Winter Weather Warnings for most of Utah and the I-70 corridor we were planning to take through Colorado the day after.

We decided, sadly, that we had to skip Bryce Canyon on Monday and to alter our route to take us through the southernmost part of Colorado (via Lake Powell, a brief jaunt through New Mexico and past the four corners monument), stopping to spend Monday night in Cortez, which is just 10 minutes away from our back-up park: Mesa Verde. Sadly, the snow storm throughout the state was even worse than forecast, and it was just too snowy for us to visit Mesa-Verde either. We were still a good 8 hours of driving from home, so we decided to end our trip a day sooner than previously planned and just spend the Tuesday driving back to Denver. There was one sketchy moment as we had to head up and over a mountain pass which had recently seen a lot of snow, but the roads were quiet and we made it to back to Denver by the evening of Tuesday 29th, without incident.

On the Saturday (December 3rd), I left Mum at the mall for a bit while I went to meet the person I'd been seeing for almost a year so we could have a frank conversation. We had needed to talk about the status of our for-some-reason stalling relationship for a while, and agreed to take a break. At the time, just as I do today, I believed this was the right choice for both of us, but that hasn't made it any less tough, because, deep down, I've realized that I _really_ like this person, though I did a bad job of showing that. After that, I'm glad I had my Mum there to talk things through with, and I don't think my ensuing sadness really kicked in over the next few days or affected her visit - we didn't have a whole lot of other 'activities' planned anyway. Mum took off on Tuesday 6th and I realized I had to take action instead of moping, deciding get out of Denver for a week by convincing my boss I needed to visit Santa Barbara _next week_.

So, on the afternoon of Sunday 11th, I flew out to LAX, rented a car and drove up to Santa Barbara (stopping in Isla Vista to get Freebirds nachos 'on the way', naturally). I worked from the office through Thursday, felt productive, and ever so slightly better about myself, and made my way up to the Bay Area for the weekend. On the way up to stay with Pat and Laura in Oakland, I had dinner in San Jose with Sarah, who I hadn't seen for a year. It was really nice to catch up with her, and she was kind enough to let me talk about the state of my love-life, and I listened to her as she talked about hers as well.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-pat-laura-yoshi.jpg" title="San Francisco" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

I spent Friday 16th working from Oakland, and the rest of that weekend with Pat, Laura and Yoshi. On Saturday, we visited the beautiful lookout over the Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco and the Bay beyond, before heading up to Russian River brewing for pizza and their delicious, highly-sought-after beer. On Sunday I joined their D&D (or Anima, or some other similar rule-set) game, reprising my role of Louisiana Smith, the whip-cracking, fedora-wearing, quick-witted action-hero archaeologist. It was a great weekend with great friends, who I'm extremely grateful to have in my life, and who definitely gave me some cheer.

### Interlude

I returned home from the Bay Area on the night of Monday December 19th and spent what now seems like a whopping ten straight nights at home in Denver. I went to Michelle's parent's house for Xmas day and it was nice to see everyone. Otherwise I think this period was fairly uneventful, aside from a slow descent back into feeling rather sorry for myself and/or confused about what exactly I want from a romantic relationship, and wondering if I might have blown it with someone who could really make me very happy.

### Around the World in 45 Days

As mentioned above, December 29th 2016 through to February 12th 2017 marks a particularly intensive 45-day period of travel in which I spent 39 nights away, and only 6 at home.

##### Hawaii

On Thursday December 29th I flew from Denver to Honolulu to spend New Year's staying at Chris' house where a total of eight of us (including six math PhDs) caught up, discussed old times and adventured around Hawaii.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/gang-oahu.jpg" title="The Gang" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

I rented a BMW 1-series convertible to enjoy Oahu in, and it was an excellent decision. My car was the one people wanted to ride in... as long as it wasn't raining. Various combinations of us spent Friday 30th, Saturday 31st and Sunday 1st seeing the sights of Oahu by day, and drinking and reading comics at Chris' by night. We went to the beach a few times, we snorkeled at some amazing reefs, we saw whales frolicking (or, more likely, fucking) while the sun set, we ate some delicious (and not so delicious) food, and we reminded each other how well we all get along, and had some great chats about life, love and future ambitions. I think we all agreed we needed to make it a far more regular catch-up than the many years it had been since we were all together.

On Tuesday 2nd, after half of the gang had returned back to the mainland, Chris and I caught a flight to Kona on the West coast of the Big Island, where we'd spend the next 48 hours or so. This was without doubt one of the most spectacular trips I've ever taken. It actually started somewhat badly, as we made our way 9000ft up Mauna Kea (the world's tallest mountain) to stop at the visitor center to try and catch the sunset. Sadly, there was far too much cloud and while it was clearing at a rapid rate, it just didn't go away fast enough for us to see what I'm told is an amazing sunset.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-chris-mauna-kea.jpg" title="Mauna Kea sunset" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

Once the sun has gone down, Mauna Kea is literally the best place in the world to view the stars. While we weren't observing from the summit, which is at 14000ft above sea level and is home to a host of world-class telescopes, the visitor center is still a great place to observe the night sky - volunteer astronomers set up several telescopes pointed at notable bodies in the sky, while a guide gives 'star tours' using a laser-pointer to help visitors understand what they're seeing. Once again we were a little unfortunate, because the Moon was unusually bright that night, which meant the sky was not as impressive as I was assured it can be. Nonetheless, it was still a very clear and impressive view of the sky, in which I could (just about) make out the Milky Way, among other things.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/lava-flow.jpg" title="Lava Flow" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

We drove back down the dormant volcano to spend the night on the Eastern side of the island, in Hilo. On Wednesday morning, after breakfast at a 'world famous' pancake house (featuring multiple pictures of visits from The Rock, among other celebrities), we made our way to Volcanos National Park, which is the site of (very!) active volcanic activity. We walked on recently formed lava, we saw some craters from old volcanos, we saw some steam vents. All very impressive in their own right, but nothing compared to the incredible sights to come. We left the park and drove for about 90 minutes to the coast, from where we hiked for four miles past huge fields of very recently dried lava. We were able to make our way to a viewing point very close to where vast amounts of bright, glowing orange lava were flowing like a waterfall off the edge of the island into the ocean, causing huge plumes of steam to explode into the air. We spent a good deal of time observing that, before hiking a little further, trying (but failing) to find some lava that was flowing above ground. The aforementioned 'lava-fall' was, at that time, coming from a stream of lava that was a little under the ground. We were able to stand right above where it was flowing, and we could certainly feel the heat, but sadly we were not able to walk up to the flowing lava and offend the locals by poking the lava (one of their their gods) with a stick.

Night had fallen by the time we got back to the car after a long and hard hike. We went to get dinner and check into our hotel before hauling our exhausted asses back out and back up to the National Park to observe the active volcano crater by night. Once again we were treated to a truly spectacular sight. In the dark of night we could very clearly see the magma boiling away in huge eruptions that leapt into the night sky. Furthermore, we could hear the roar of the magma as it crashed around in the crater - it sounded very much like the ocean during a storm.

I've seen some beautiful and amazing things on my various travels around the world, but I don't think it's a stretch to say that on Tuesday January 3rd I saw two of the top five sights I've ever witnessed.

Our return flight to Honolulu out of Kona on the West coast of the Big Island was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. We got up early and decided to drive the scenic route, along the south coast of the island. A  beautiful drive that afforded us some lovely views of the island's mountains and coastline, but ultimately uneventful. We stopped for a flight of beers at Kona Brewing before our flight, and then had a couple more beers at the airport for good measure, while we reminisced on the sights we'd seen over the previous 2 days.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-chris-kona.jpg" title="Kona Brew Co" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

For the final two days I spent on Oahu, everyone else had left, and I simply worked from Chris' place and had a fairly low-key end to the trip, drinking, eating and chatting with Chris about life and comics.

##### Scotland

I returned from Hawaii on Saturday January 7th, spent two nights at home, then began a 22-hour, three-legged journey to Edinburgh, via Washington DC and Paris on Monday 9th (arriving lunchtime on Tuesday 10th). This was a work trip, so while my flights and food were paid for, it meant I was working on all of the week days, and had to get to bed at a somewhat reasonable hour most nights. I stayed with Alistair and Niki, who are very kind to so frequently put me up for such long stretches. Aside from the usual drinking of real ales and eating of terribly bad/delicious food, this trip was largely uneventful. 

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-shooting.jpg" title="Rob Shooting" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

One thing worth calling out, though, is a trip to Callum's farm, where I fed his sheep, drove his fabulously fun 4x4 cart around, and shot my first ever gun at clay pigeons. Once again (and this is a theme of most of my trips recently) it was spending time eating, drinking and chatting with my friends that was the real highlight of the trip. I do just enjoy being in the city of Edinburgh too. It has a lot of good food and drink, and the people are friendly, and it just feels comfortable and, I suppose, familiar. It has a lot of what I enjoy about the UK, and very little of what I dislike - it sure gets dark early in the winter though! In particular, I had a hard time finding a good opportunity to go for a run.

##### San Francisco

After another 22-ish hour 3-legged journey home, I arrived back in Denver on Thursday January 19th where I had four nights to relax at home before getting back on a plane, this time to San Francisco, on Monday January 23rd. 

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-mum-muir.jpg" title="Rob Shooting" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

After my car rental was cancelled minutes before my plane took off, Sarah very kindly volunteered to drive up to SFO to pick me up and deliver me to Pat and Laura's in Oakland. We stopped for dinner on the way and once again had a nice time chatting about life. I worked from Pat and Laura's on Tuesday, before we drove down to Oakland airport to pick up my Mum. Pat and Laura had _very_ kindly agreed to let both her and me stay at theirs for two days, while I took my Mum on a tour of the Bay Area, which she'd never visited before. We went to Muir Woods (aka Endor!) and saw the redwoods, which has long been very high on my Mum's bucket list. We went to Golden Gate park, drove across all the famous bridges, stopped at some great vistas, ate at diners, went to the beach, visited the Ferry Building, ate authentic tacos and generally had a pretty great 2-day tour of SF, before heading to SFO on the evening of Thursday 26th where we boarded a plane to Nadi, Fiji.

##### Fiji

Now, the real purpose of my Mum's travels was to make her way to New Zealand where she's spending the best part of a month visiting her newborn granddaughter at my brother's new house just outside Christchurch. Before we made it there, though, we had a three-day layover in Fiji. When booking flights through Fiji Airways, you can add multi-day layovers at no extra cost. Since getting from the US to Christchurch requires having a layover _somewhere_, we decided there are worse ways to do it than spend three days in Fiji. In retrospect, I think that while we're both glad we experienced it, it wasn't a particularly great way to spend those three days.

Nadi, where the international airport is located, is a very small 3rd-world town. There are no real beaches to speak of, the houses, shops and restaurants are all kinda sketchy and to top it off, it was very hot and _very_ humid.

We arrived very early on Saturday 28th (we crossed the timeline and completely skipped Friday) but were allowed to check in to the AirBnB I'd booked for us. It was a small two-bedroom apartment attached to a house owned by a Fijian-Indian family who were kinda... weird. On the first day, we were both recovering from jet-lag (a 12 hour shift for Mum) and we were ultimately content to just sit/lay around in the apartment avoiding the heat. The AirBnB hosts seemed a little concerned by this and would frequently come and stick their heads in the window to ask if we wanted a lift somewhere, or some mediocre 'Indian' food. They were just trying to be kind, but Mum and I, in our Britishness, just wanted to be left alone! 

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-mum-fiji.jpg" title="Rob and Mum at Fiji" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

The second day was by far the best. We took a 90ish minute boat trip around a number of the (tiny!) Fijian islands, before being dropped off at our island destination for the day: Mana. This island was probably about a mile long and maybe a quarter of a mile wide and was far, far more like what you're picturing when you think of Fijian paradise: palm trees, long golden beaches, clear blue skies and clear blue oceans. There seemed to be maybe two 'resorts' on the island, and our ticket allowed us to spend the day at one such, together with a surprisingly nice buffet lunch which we ate with an idyllic view of the ocean and some neighboring islands (including the one Tom Hanks was stranded on, inspiring the movie Castaway).

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-mum-fiji-2.jpg" title="More Fiji" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

On the final full day, we again spent the day avoiding the heat in our apartment, again concerning our overly-keen hosts. It was extremely uneventful and quite relaxing. I recall that I finished reading V for Vendetta, one of many books that Chris had recommended to me a few weeks prior.

Overall, I'd say that a visit to Fiji could be fun, but I'd arrange things very differently next time - if I do decide to have a multi-day Fijian layover again, I would hop on a boat to a smaller resort island as soon as possible, and stay for as long as possible. At the end of the day, though, it strikes me as very much a "lay by the beach and relax, or play in the ocean" type vacation, and I can only put up with that for a couple of days before boredom sets in.

##### New Zealand

Early on the morning of Tuesday January 31st, Mum and I ended our Fijian layover-stravanza and got on the 3ish hour flight from Fiji to Christchurch, where we were met by my brother, his fiancee and their baby daughter Grace, my Mum's first grandchild.

This trip was very much about spending time with family, and not seeing the spectacular sights that New Zealand has to offer. I'm lucky enough that I've seen some such sights on previous visits, but I think on future trips, when Grace is a little older, I might insist that we (or at the very least I) take a tour to see the southern part of the country. I suppose it didn't help that I was working full time during my visit, and while the shifted hours meant I was generally done for the day by 1 or 2pm, it probably did affect our ability to do anything adventurous like hiking in the hills or visiting the beach, which are now slightly further away than they were when my brother lived closer to town.

After previous visits I've complained that New Zealand's beer is terrible, and while that's true of the major brands, I did finally discover some excellent microbreweries - one brew-pub in particular that's only about ten minutes from my brother's place had some outstanding beers, including some British-style cask ales. I will definitely insist on revisiting that place on all future stays.

I spent a total of ten nights in New Zealand, and I believe I was able to go for a run on every day I was there. I'm currently in the midst of some intensive training for a half-marathon, that requires I run six days a week, at precisely prescribed distances and speeds. I knew it would be a challenge to stick to this schedule while traveling, and that was certainly true in some places, but my brother's neighborhood was very easy to run in (if a little boring by the second week), and the weather was generally ideal for it. Overall, I made some great progress with my training that's made me far more optimistic about how the race will go.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-grace.jpg" title="Rob and Grace" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

It was, of course, lovely to meet my baby niece, and I look forward to seeing her grow up. I've decided to make an effort to visit New Zealand a little more often than I have been, so I can be a slightly bigger part of her life. That strikes me as much less effort and expense than having a child of my own.

While it's great to spend time with my family (and we do see far too little of each other, being so spread out), after ten days or so I definitely find there's a certain stress of being around it all and, for whatever reason, that I'm not really getting to live my life quite as freely as I would otherwise. By the end of the trip I definitely found myself ready to head home - though I'm sure the totality of the stress of travel and being away for so long also played a big part in that.

##### Australia

While I arrived in New Zealand on January 31st, and left on February 11th, I did take the chance to spend the middle weekend (Saturday and Sunday the 4th and 5th of February) visiting Tom, a very old friend from my school days who now lives with his wife in a beautiful 31st-floor apartment overlooking Sydney.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/rob-sydney-opera.jpg" title="Sydney Opera House" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

I made my brother get up very, very early on Saturday morning to take me to the airport, from where it was about a three hour flight to Sydney. I jumped in a cab and met Tom and Ruth at a fancy/hipster breakfast place just down the street from their apartment. After breakfast, Tom took me on a walking tour of Sydney, stopping for a drink or two at the Opera House, another three or four on a rooftop pub in town, and then several more at a spectacular bar overlooking Bondi beach. All the while we caught up on where life had taken us in the past fifteen years and reminisced about our school day shenanigans (especially our trip with the boys to Tenerife at 17). Our seat at the bar afforded us an excellent view of the beautiful people of Bondi beach, who wore a strange mix of swimwear and party wear that looked far too hot for the conditions.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/sydney-beach.jpg" title="Sydney Beach" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

On Sunday (after breakfast at another fancy/hipster place), we went to a different beach slightly south of Bondi where we sunbathed and swam. The water was very pleasant (if somewhat full of seaweed) and the waves were certainly the biggest I've ever encountered. The lifeguards are quite strict about swimmers staying in the middle portion of the beach (which is in a natural bay), so there was no real danger of hitting rocks, or being swept away. That said, it was quite striking how powerless I felt when being carried around by some of the bigger waves. Often I would find myself a good 20-30 yards from where the wave had picked me up. It was a very fun time, and I'm sure I'd only get more confident if I swam there more often, but after a while the mental and physical energy required to stay afloat became a little too much and I returned to the lovely warm sandy beach.

We met an Aussie friend of Tom's at the beach, before the three of us hiked in the heat to a nice burger bar for a quick dinner, before I had to jump in a cab back to the airport thus ending my whistle-stop visit. I'll definitely be back. Sydney struck me as a thriving, modern city, with outstanding restaurants, bars and culture, with an absolutely lovely beach as a backdrop. It was rather like what I want a city in California to be, but which doesn't exist there.

##### Fiji part two

My Mum and brother took me to Christchurch airport right after I finished work for the day on Saturday February 11th. If I had known what Nadi was like when I booked my flights, I probably wouldn't have arranged a 27-hour layover. If I had known it would be stormy and wet, I _definitely_ wouldn't have. None-the-less, that's where I find myself today, as I write this a few hours before I head to the airport to finally catch a flight home to Denver (via LAX) on the afternoon of Sunday February 12th.

<img align="left" src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/post-images/nadi-rain.jpg" title="Nadi Rain" width="40%" style="margin:0 2.5rem 2.5rem -10%">

On this occasion I stayed in a private room at a backpacker's hostel, and I honestly far prefer it to the AirBnB - though I'm not sure Mum would have. There's a lot of younger backpacking European, American and Australian tourists staying at this and nearby resorts, and last night I found myself eating dinner next to three folks from the UK. I struck up conversation with them, we had a few beers, chatted about our respective travel experiences, and it was a pleasant way to spend the evening.

### Final Thoughts

I've really enjoyed traveling around for the past few months, but I do find myself longing for home. In chatting with old and new friends and seeing how they're all living their lives, I've had a wonderful opportunity to think and talk through my own ambitions for life. I wont stop traveling - not least because there are people and places I love spread all over the world. That said, it will probably be a while before I spend quite so far from home all at once. 

On my travels, and being around my loved ones, I feel I've really been able to get a handle on what's important to me, and what maybe was important but is no longer. I've realized that I'd very much like to have a partner to share my life with. I don't expect her to do everything that I do, but I'd love to visit new places, and revisit some of my favorites with someone I love. I'd love to share the things I'm passionate about with another person who is either passionate about them too, or at least who enjoys my passion about those things. I want to share in and discover the things that she is passionate about and to enjoy her passion. To make new friends with the people who are important to her, and to have her make friends with the people important to me.

In the weeks and months before my travel started, whenever I've spent an extended period of time at home, I've found myself getting depressed, lonely and bored. I'm hoping that this trip, following the wake-up-call that I received in December, and my realizations about what's most important to me, will give me new impetus and an avenue in which to spend my time making my life what I want it to be, and will lead to me being able to feel the happiness and enjoyment I feel while traveling, when I'm at home.
