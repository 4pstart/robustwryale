Well, I finally got around to putting this blog/website together. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I use Markdown to author my posts. I'm going to use this as a place to express my random musings, clever insigts and generally practice (and hopefully improve) my English and writing skillz. Thanks for reading!
