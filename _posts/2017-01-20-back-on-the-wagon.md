Wow, it's been two months since I wrote a blog post. That said, I did write a very short story, and spent additional time planning out both a longer version of that story, and another story I'm working on. Still, I've spent far less time writing than I would like, mostly, I fear, from a lack of inspiration (though I have been traveling a lot and simply not spending time at my laptop screen). Still, I think about awesome and interesting things all the time. And sometimes I do interesting stuff too.

So, I'm committing to write blog posts about the following:

-- My trip to Hawaii. I hung out with some good friends who I haven't seen in forever. I saw some beautiful scenery, and watched lava flow. It was a great trip and I should go into a little more detail about what aspects of it I particularly enjoyed.

-- My trip to Scotland. Ostensibly, I went to Edinburgh for work, but part of why I always enjoy my visits so much are the friends I have there, plus the nostalgia of enjoying good beer and good food. Work was genuinely way better than usual too though. I should write about how work is different when I'm there, and also all the things I get nostalgia for.

-- My thoughts on the current political situation. This is a tough one for me, because while I have a *lot* of thoughts in this area, I'm very rarely comfortable discussing them, even with close friends. I think it's fair to say I'm very left-leaning, but I do find myself very much against the grain when it comes to how to argue those politics. Basically we should be better about dealing with the world as it currently is, rather than as we think it should be. Also, I could probably spend a whole post on how people still drastically underestimate the role the media (not just the news media) plays in shaping what people feel and believe.

-- Single life. I'm always reluctant to post personal stuff on my blog because I don't know for sure if I want everyone to read it. That said, I do think there's room for me to give some honest and open insights into how my love-life has been since (or perhaps including) the first (and still only major) relationship I had from age 19-29. I still need to think about how I might feel about admitting it to the world if, say, I hadn't had sex in months. Or that I think I was totally in love with that one person, but couldn't admit it to myself, much less them. Or how I fear I take advantage of the feelings certain people have for me, even if I don't feel as strongly about them. Deep, personal stuff, that could also affect the people involved, so I'd have to talk about these topics carefully. It would be very valuable for me (and hopefully others as well) though, I think

-- In some ways, similar to the previous point, I'm reluctant to talk about my job or career in a public forum, even though I think it could be helpful to both me and potential readers. For example, if I don't feel that certain coworkersa have been performing, or supporting me in a way I need, how would I go about discussing that, how I go about fixing it, etc, in a forum potentially observed by current co-workers? I would like to discuss those aspects of my job I enjoy (and which I don't) and talk through some potential career paths that would align. Again, delacy will be important.

-- I could discuss the fiction writing I've been doing. Give some of my high level ideas, and post snippets from my stories. If I tried to make this a regular post it would encourage me to keep up the writing and I might even recieve valuable comments or feedback from friends.

-- I'd still like to write about professional wrestling, since I'm a year after getting back into it and still enjoying it as much as ever (eg: I love AJ Styles). I need to determine what kind of cadence I'd like to write at, what precisely I'd like to write about, and whether this blog where I share all these other thoughts is necessarily the right place (though I guess it'll do for now). I think it might also be worth talking about how this is an 'unusual' thing for me to enjoy, why admitting to enjoying it is hard, and ultimately why I lik eit _so_ much that I feel compelled to write about it. 

So there we have it: a whole shit-ton of stuff for me to write about, and very little by way of excuses not to do so.
