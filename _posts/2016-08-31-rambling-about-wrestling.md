I wrote the following last night when I couldn't really sleep. It's probably somewhat rambling in nature, but I don't (yet) especially enjoy heavily editing my posts, as it significantly adds to the time it takes me to get shit written. So, find below some thoughts and musings about professional wrestling and the current state of the WWE in particular. What I'm currently enjoying about the product, where I feel they're going to take things, and how those things would make me feel. It's Aug 31st 2016, and I recently finished watching the Raw and Smackdown episodes that took place 2 weeks after Summerslam, which means only one week of episodes to go until the first ever Smackdown-only PPV, Backlash.

### Rambling... Start!

#### One effect of brand-specific PPVs

I'm not convinced that they're adequately taking advantage of this opportunity (yet!), but I find it interesting that because Raw actually has a while between PPVs, we're getting (or should get!) something I've wanted for a while, which is some storylines that actually go somewhere during the week to week TV episodes. This actually would mean I'm compelled to watch every week, which, frankly isn't really the case at present (especially for Raw). I hope Smackdown benefits from this after Backlash too - It'll be really interesting to see what their creative team comes up with to fill the weeks between their PPVs, because they're already doing a far better job than Raw of moving things along each week.

#### On the state of the top/mid roster

Much as described in Gladwell's 'blink' I feel I have an 'instinctive' (or in his terms 'implicit') sense of the experience of a pro wrester. I look at guys like Crews, Neville (to some degree), Cesaro (though less so recently) and just feel 'they are good in theory but they don't make me want to watch them' it's like, they are just missing that casual confidence of movement and actions that makes a guy like Jericho or HHH seem so utterly convincing and engaging to watch.

Guys like Rollins, Ambrose, Cena, Orton, very much seem comfortable in the ring, as can only come with experience. the aforementioned 'rookies' (though of course, they're by no means utterly new to the industry) just don't quite have it (to varying degrees). I'm realizing that the exact 'it' to which I'm referring is hard for me to define. Much as Gladwell describes, it's just a feeling I get from them all.

Aside: Speaking of Y2J: Jericho has been mixing up his 'antics' (for want of a better term for those small & big things he says on the mic and does in the ring ). He has a real nose for what'll go over and what wont, or perhaps more importantly, he can tell when something's getting stale and drops it and tries something else. He's so good at what he does (ha!) that he can just confidently tweak what he's doing, more or less on the fly, and get the crowd back in the palm of his hand. He wasn't always quite this good (though he has always been very good) at being _this_ engaging to watch. I hope he finds this current phase and way of working sufficiently interesting to stick around for a little bit.


#### On current/recent storylines

Interesting that they've given the belts to new guys (who hadn't been in the title picture much/at all right up until a few weeks before they won it) recently. I'm talking about Ambrose, Balor, Owens. I haven't been watching for that long; I wonder how much they were doing that (or how often this happened for a few new champs in a row)  3-8 years ago? I guess not much, given what I know about the former champions from that era. I wonder if they will keep it up at something like this rate? Will it get stale if they do? (I mean, we can't have a new 1st-time champ every 3 months forever!) Hell, there aren't many people who even qualify (but would be credible) any more! Maybe guys like Kofi, Big E, Cesaro, (I suppose, Jericho in a way might qualify, in the sense that he hasn't been in the title picture for a very long time and would be an 'out of the blue, but credible' winner).

They really seem to be building AJ Styles up. I could possibly see him lose to Ambrose, but honestly, they could do with making Dean look a little stronger recently. They make him to be too much of a 'fool' during the weekly shows, so we don't see him kick ass enough and it's a bit incongruent next to his dominating PPV title match wins. They need to do something to mix up his character. Maybe losing the title qualifies? He could definitely lose it credibly to AJ, though I suspect they'd add at least _some_ shenanigans. 

After that who on SD will be after it next? Wyatt? Orton I guess could be interesting (especially if AJ has the belt). Cena? I don't want to see Cena go over in AJvCena III for the title. It would completely undermine AJ's win at Summerslam (unless, possibly, if AJ wins it back off Cena later). Put Ziggler back in the frame again? Miz? I actually hope they keep Miz's IC reign going, and really have him milk how amazing he is for having it for so long, but actually give him credible opponents (Ziggler's a good start). 

On the Raw side \*, I guess Balor will be back in the picture by WM. Rollins will always be around, as will Reigns\*\*. Joe may well come to Raw soon, he'd probably be in the picture. How long until Nakamura is called up and in the picture? I think he still has a few months more needed to learn that 'WWE style'. How long until they start actually doing something with Strowman? The squashes are kinda fun, but they're starting to get stale and wont last much longer. He needs to start fighting gradually stronger and more well-known wrestlers and really build him up. I wonder who will finally break his winning streak? I wonder how long they'll spend building him up or if they really will follow through with what their teasing, which is just having a truly unbeatable monster heel (Lesnar-style). They'll probably just have Lesnar destroy him and that will be that for yet another chance to make Lesnar interesting...

\* I keep wanting to type 'RAW', like it's an acronym, or possibly being yelled. Is that how WWE officially formats it? I just looked it up: No. I'm just a weirdo.
\*\*They need to keep giving Reigns a sniff (especially in these multi man matches, especially if he can be considered a little unfortunate to lose, so he still stays credible) but also (and more importantly) give him at least 2 decent feuds away from the title so he stops seeming so much like the guy they're desperate to push. Actually let him get himself over again, but over enough that people wont just roll their eyes and boo him again if you shove him right back into the title picture. I think basically, he simply can't be allowed to have the title for at least a year.

I need to watch more NXT, but there's already so much to watch, it's hard to justify. Regal might qualify as justification enough...
