Somehow it's already been ten days since my last post, so it's certainly time for an update. I wrote my previous post from an interesting coffee shop on a Friday lunchtime in San Francisco. I'm writing this on a Monday afternoon at a brewery in Denver. I think it's fair to say that my recent breakup and its fallout still occupies a significant portion of my thoughts. I've read plenty of advice that suggests the best approach is to really 'lean into it' by admitting my feelings, not feeling embarrassed or guilty for having them, but also to keep looking forward and exploring what opportunities the future may bring.

On that topic, I've been considering a move away from Denver, at least on a trial basis (nothing would be stopping me from moving back when I'd like to - especially since I own a home here). The primary candidates for a destination are San Francisco (or greater Bay Area), or the Pacific NorthWest (Portland or Seattle). I have friends in all of those cities, which would make settling in somewhat easier, plus the job opportunities in my particular field are tremendous (a Director of Engineering at Google makes upwards of quarter of a million a year).

Let's be honest. All the cities/areas I'm choosing between have a lot in common and not much (that I care about) differentiating them. They all offer more world-class dining, drinking and entertainment options than I'll ever be able to experience. They are all close to breathtaking natural wonders as well as well-served international airports. I could move to any of these places tomorrow and my lifestyle would be largely unchanged. I could find people and places to play Magic and soccer, make new friends and have ample dating opportunities. If I got a job offer that increased my salary to more than match the cost-of-living increase in any of those places, I think I would be foolish not to take the opportunity and move.

That said, I do feel a reluctance and sadness about the prospect. For one thing I have made some friends here who I would miss (to varying extents, but some of them greatly). I have a great house in a great neighborhood, I know the good bars and restaurants, but still have plenty to see and discover. The weather here is fantastic (for me) and possibly better than in any of the places I'm considering (though needing winter tires is a pain!).

Part of me does worry about how it would feel to live in the same city as my ex. It will be interesting to see how my 'recovery' continues over the next few weeks, but I still think of her more than I'd like (namely, a LOT) and I wonder and worry if it would be harder for me to know she's close by. On the other hand, there's very much a possibility that we could become good friends, and that would be an awesome thing to have in a new city.

Ultimately, I can think of very few items that weigh heavily in the 'pro' or 'con' column for a move to any of the places I'm considering (though a drastic salary increase would certainly tip me into the heavy 'pro' direction). I'm in a phase of my life where I have ultimate freedom and flexibility to move, and I think that possibility of new experiences and opportunities is one which I'm very much inclined to take, because I can only see my future self regretting turning down that chance. 

It will be interesting to see what the next few weeks and months hold, but I think there's a distinct possibility that I start 2018 in a new city and that's honestly an exciting prospect to me.
