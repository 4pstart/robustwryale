I like football

Actually I like a lot of sports, but football (the kind where you kick the ball with your foot) is my favorite. Why do people like sports? It's crazy in every single instance. Basically, arbitrarily rooting for an organization to succeed in their literally meaningless endeavors against all of the other organizations. I can have a favorite player of the sport. That maybe makes some kind of sense. It's a little like art in that it's an ultimately human thing to appreciate the displays of prowess. Football has a good mix of individual skill, mixed with teamwork and tactics. Also, scoring a point is precisely the right amount of difficulty/rarity to make it a Big Deal worthy of celebration when it finally happens.
