So, it's been a few days rather than a few months since my last post and I wasn't sure I had anything specific to write about until I remembered that the whole reason I came up with a "Favorite Games" series is so I always had something to write about, even when inspiration was drying up. With that in mind, here's the second entry in that series!

### Super Mario 64

I don't think any game has ever left an impression on me quite like the first time I ever played Super Mario 64.

To give some context, I first played this game several months before its release, on a special touring Nintendo bus full of N64s and launch titles for the system. My friend and I seemed to be in a very small minority of people in my town who were aware this bus existed and, as I recall, we spent two full days in the tail end of 1996 developing blisters on our thumbs in what was one of the coolest video-game experiences I'll ever have. There were no lines to play, and no cost to us to get into the event. As a result we were allowed to just post up at whichever machine we wanted and play this mind-blowing, revolutionary, world-rocking game to our hearts' content. A couple of other games (notably Waverace 64 and Pilotwings 64) were also available and I played them briefly, but Super Mario 64 was so significant, so overwhelmingly new and amazing of an experience, that there was no dragging me away from it.

While it's not accurate to call Mario 64 the first ever 3D game (though it was certainly one of the earliest 'true' 3D games - Quake, which came out a few months later in 1996 being another), it certainly is fair to say that Mario 64 was the first ever 3D platform/adventure game that presented you with a fully three-dimensional world to explore and interact with. Just like Super Mario Bros. before it, Super Mario 64 ushered in a new genre of video game and irrevocably altered the landscape of gaming. And 13 year-old me could barely believe what he was playing.

Some now-ubiquitous gameplay elements introduced or pioneered by Super Mario 64, and some of its achievements include:

- first game to successfully bring a series of 2D games into full 3D
- multiple missions within a single level
- a controllable 'camera' that follows the protagonist around while allowing you to see where you need to go next
- introduced alongside the analog stick, which allowed for far better precision of movement than seen before
- very non-linear gameplay in a 3D environment
- First game to feature the voice of Super Mario (played by Charles Martinet) :D

Numerous 3D platform games came out in the years following, and had varying levels of commercial and critical success, and few could be considered to be better than Super Mario 64. As I write this, a full 20 years since the game came out, I think it's fair to say it has been surpassed - not least by Nintendo's own follow-ups (Super Mario Galaxy, Galaxy 2 and 3D-World can all put forth a case to being the best 3D-platformer of all time). Super Mario 64 also lay the much of the groundwork for Shigeru Miyamoto's directorial follow-up, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which it's utterly uncontroversial to declare as a very strong candidate for the best game of all time. It's much easier to see how Ocarina of Time is a predecessor and very heavy influencer of pretty much every modern action/adventure game, but it wouldn't exist (or, at least, be nearly the game it is) without the things accomplished by Super Mario 64.


Here's an early "Bowser's Castle"-type level, that's far more linear than the other, "open world"-style levels in Super Mario 64, but actually far closer in style to the type of level seen in later 3D Mario games. It's a level that's just pure platforming, putting to the test the skills a player should have developed at this stage of the game.

Ultimately it was the overwhelming 'newness' of Super Mario 64 that means I'll never forget that first time playing it on that bus, and why I was a day 1 N64 owner, who has played, replayed and thoroughly explored the hell out of this game. All of the above innovations and gameplay elements that have today permeated gaming, I could tell at the time (even if I couldn't articulate why), were something special. I don't know if we'll ever see as large of a step up in video gaming as was introduced with Super Mario 64, but if we do, it'll be something special indeed.
