### Recent Happenings

I believe it's about time I wrote another post covering some general happenings and experiences from my life. 

#### Writing

I've been enjoying writing these blog posts, and I think I might enjoy writing enough that I'd like to make a 'thing' of it. I suppose by that I mean a way to share my writing with more people, and let's be honest, make some (or a lot of) money from it. If I really want to improve as a writer, I think I need to set some 'goals'. Sadly, I don't know enough about writing to know what some sensible goals should be. So I think perhaps the first goal is "read about writing". Another goal might be "write something that will be 'published'", by which I probably mean on a 'well-read' blog that solicits for contributions, since I doubt readership of this blog is going to skyrocket any time soon, and that great American novel is probably a few years away at best... That means coming up with topics that other people might actually want to read about, rather than the current eclectic selection of satisfying-only-to-me ramblings I currently go for.

Another thing. My touch typing is decent, but I wonder if there's some kind of exercise I could do that would make me an even better typist. I will look into that too. At the very least I need to stop typing 'teh' instead of 'the'...

#### Recent Movie Review

The two movies I've recently watch and am inclined to write about are "Batman vs Superman" and "Terminator: Genisys". Both of these movies were pretty badly reviewed, both by the mainstream and nerdy press (those two are becoming fairly overlapped these days) and by my nerdy friends. Perhaps it had something to do with, uh, my 'state of mind' while watching them, but I really enjoyed both movies for what they were. I watched Terminator last night, so I'll start with that. 

Terminator has some really, really dumb moments - including about 3 too many one-liners ("I'll be back" is probably all you need to keep). It has horrible casting, in that there must be 50 actors who would have played a better Sarah Connor (perhaps someone who can do a decent American accent!) than the otherwise great Emilia Clarke. Likewise, I'm not sure that the super shifty-looking-even-from-the-start John Connor was especially well done either. The special effects on the Terminators were amazing, but everywhere else in the film were awful - the helicopter chase in particular looked like something from a 10 year old video game. That said, I thought the time travel actually made some kind of sense (at least as much as it could for a movie of this type), the basic "terminator trying to stop the good guys from saving the world" premise was done in an interesting way, and the "father figure terminator" stuff was a cool idea reasonably well executed (at first I was a little annoyed that it made no sense that he had emotions, but then we don't actually know who sent him or where he came from, so who knows what 'enhancements' this terminator has). Anyway, I think with a better cast, higher SFX budget, and slightly better dialog, this would have been a classic. A lot of the ingredients were there and I was still able to appreciate them, though I totally see why others wouldn't.

As for BvS. Hmm. I actually thought it was a really good modern version of a 90s era comic book movie. It was soooooooo melodramatic, I couldn't help but enjoy it for that. A lot of people have said it was just way too 'dark', but I just interpreted all that as over-the-top melodrama. I mean the whole thing is absurd! It's about a guy who dresses as a bat to scare criminals, but who's morals have been affected by the past actions of an evil clown. This bat-guy is mad at a space alien who looks just like us, but has magical powers. There's another comically-evil guy who wants these guys to fight, and fair enough, who doesn't? How can anyone say that anything that happens in this movie is "too serious"?? It was utterly ridiculous from minute one, and I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.

In the case of both of these movies, I certainly wouldn't want to watch movies like them every night. I also like to watch movies that make me think, that make me laugh, that make me feel something for the characters. But not every movie has to have those things in order to be enjoyable. I think people take these things way too seriously.

#### Twilight Princess

I was debating whether to make a "favorite games" post about The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, and make no mistake, it's definitely up there. But, having just replayed the recent HD remaster on the Wii U, on reflection, it's not a 'great' like the other games in that set. Of all the home-console main series Zelda games (of which there are only Legend of Zelda, Adventure of Link, Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword to span 30 years), I think Twilight Princess has the lowest lows, but also the highest highs. 

The game is very slow to get started, and the sections where you're stuck in wolf form, forced to use the 'smell' sense feel very 'oppressive'. These sections of the game are dark, dreary, slow and simply not fun to play. But it's almost like that's an intentional design decision, because the contrast of those sections with later sections is just so dramatic. It makes you feel like you really earned the awesome later experiences. 

On those awesome experiences: the dungeons in this game are so imaginative, and more than any other game in the series, really feel like a part of the larger world. They each have their own character and story. The Yeti's mansion, the temple of time, the temple where you get the spinner. All amazing. I also think it does a great job with the storyline, feeling like a classic 80s movie adventure, where you really have a compelling reason for going to each place next - at least it didn't feel like it was always just "there's a McGuffin here you should acquire". The items like dual-hookshots, bomb-arrows and spinner in particular are just super fun gameplay elements and exceed pretty much anything in other games in the series. 

The boss battles are all very creative and almost always fun to play. They do a great job (as they often do throughout the series) of making the boss feel like a logical finale to the dungeon. I think the boss battles in this game are the most fun to play, but also among the easiest in the series, which was often slightly anticlimactic. They are a decent metaphor for the game as a whole really: really fun, very 'coherent', but ultimately a slight let down. 

Overall the game also just feels a little safe. It fits nicely alongside LoZ, LttP and OoT as a 'standard', save the land of Hyrule from great evil adventure. But coming after all those revolutionary classics it just doesn't move the needle enough like those games did. Damn do those game ever set a high bar for creating a unique experience, but as amazing as Twilight Princess is, the fact it doesn't re-set the bar in the same way that its forebears did will always render it a disappointment. Which is crazy because it's also amazing!
